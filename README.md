# DiscordQuestPlaceholder - specifix5
Complete Stream Quests on Discord without actually playing the games!
This is because of how they work, Discord judges a game by its name so
for example, if you rename an .exe to "genshinimpact.exe" Discord will
think that you're playing Genshin Impact, thus progressing the quest
without sacrificing 200GB on your drive for a badge

This app automatically creates its own directory for each game, 
ensuring Discord can detect it correctly—no manual renaming or path adjustments required. 
Compatibility Fixes: Some games require a subfolder with the executable inside for Discord to detect them correctly, 
and this app handles that automatically.
